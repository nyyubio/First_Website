      <description>I am a bioinformatician in the process of converting into a data scientist. Totally nerdy about data visualization, and studying data trends. Also a foodie, climber, and yogi. Using the coronavirus quarantine period to teach myself to make a website, visualize coronavirus data, and machine learning / AI stuff.</description>

      <description>This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from [Robert Koch Institute]. Data up to April 1, 2020 (not updated every day).
 
Cumulative number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany in linear scale since 100th case Only the top 10 states with the highest number of cases are plotted.
 
 Number of confirmed cases (Logarithmic scale)</description>

What better time than now to teach myself some skills that will make me more employable when pandemic become under control and the economy goes into recovery!</description>
