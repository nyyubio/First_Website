      <description>Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related links Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center: Latest data and news on the coronavirus outbreak, with dashboards and many useful data visualizations.
ECDC: European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which has pretty good updated data and visualizations for the coronavirus outbreak.
WHO page for coronavirus pandemic: The official numbers from WHO. Their numbers tend to be a bit behind Johns Hopkins and ECDC though.
Our World in Data: Clean data visualization and statistics about the coronavirus pandemic in the world, including number of cases, amount of testing performed in each country, number of deaths, mortality rates, etc.</description>

      <description>I am a bioinformatician who is totally nerdy about data visualization, and studying data trends. Also a foodie, climber, and yogi. I am using the coronavirus quarantine period to teach myself to make a website, visualize coronavirus data, and machine learning / AI stuff.</description>

This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from ECDC. Data used from December 31, 2019-April 14, 2020 (not updated every day).
 
Doubling time for new cases and deaths I chose 10 countries to compare the rates of increase (in terms of doubling time) for the number of cases and the number of deaths, similar to the [NYT case growth rate visualization].</description>

May 9, 2020: Added data for all 16 states for all graphs.
Note: added Saarland data on April 11 as its cases and deaths are rising quite fast while the numbers in many other states are stabilizing.
This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from the Robert Koch Institute. Data used from March 15-April 7, 2020 (not updated every day).</description>
