Cumulative number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany in linear scale since March 15, 2020  
 Number of confirmed new cases in Germany since March 15, 2020 This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed new cases. Each data point is averaged over 7 previous consecutive days . Note: This is not necessarily reflective in the increase of actual number of cases each day, since the number of tests for the virus has been increasing as the pandemic progressed.</description>

This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from the Robert Koch Institute. Data used from March 15, 2020 (not updated every day).

      <description>Questions regarding coronavirus It has been nearly 2 months since I started this website. I have been mostly staying at home, applying for jobs, and following the coronavirus pandemic development pretty closely.

This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from ECDC. Data used from December 31, 2019-April 14, 2020 (not updated every day).
