Data source: Our World In Data
December 2, 2020: Our World In Data originally obtained their data from ECDC. They have since switched data source to John Hopkins, and the daily numbers looked different from ECDC/RKI, due to different ways of updating their data. Therefore I have switched data source to RKI which seems to be the primary source for ECDC.

This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from the Robert Koch Institute. Data used from March 15, 2020 (not updated every day).
For more extensive information about SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in English, see here.

      <description>Questions regarding coronavirus It has been nearly 2 months since I started this website. I have been mostly staying at home, applying for jobs, and following the coronavirus pandemic development pretty closely. As of May 14, many countries in Europe have started to ease the lockdown measures. Countries with a lot of cases, such as Spain, Italy, France, Belgium etc. have since large drops in numbers of new cases and deaths per day.</description>
