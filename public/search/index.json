I have always wanted to learn make a webpage, but lacked time, focus, and interesting contents to place on the website. I am currently searching for employement, but due to the coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 outbreak, both the economy and I are undergoing a lockdown right now. What better time than now to teach myself some skills that will make me more employable when pandemic become under control and the economy goes into recovery!\nI plan to work on the following topics during the lockdown:\n Learn to make a website Improve my data visualization skills Play with machine learning algorthms (that is a step before the AI / Deep learning stuff) Follow the SARS-Cov-2 development with the data visualization stuff Market myself as a data scientist ðŸ’ª ðŸ•¶  I am learning through blogdown (because I want to be able to post graphs generated by R) and Hugo. I chose the Minimo theme as I thought it is clean looking and would be simple to use. Was surprised by how much there is to learn! Taxonomy, widgets\u0026hellip; this sure is different from html coding in the 90s ðŸ˜µ !\nMy initial plan was just about learning to make different types of graphs and maybe some javascript, but for the past few days, so many thoughts and strong emotions went through my mind while following the coronavirus pandemic development, so I will also try to process my thoughts about this pandemic in my blog as it unfolds in realtime.\n","href":"/blog/firstpost/","title":"First post of the site"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/introduction/","title":"introduction"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/motivations/","title":"motivations"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/nyyubio/","title":"nyyubio"},{"content":"","href":"/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/config/","title":"Configuration"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/og/","title":"Opengraph"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"}]
