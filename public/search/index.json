I have been mostly staying at home, applying for jobs, and following the coronavirus pandemic development pretty closely. As of May 14, many countries in Europe have started to ease the lockdown measures. Countries with a lot of cases, such as Spain, Italy, France, Belgium etc. have since large drops in numbers of new cases and deaths per day. Taiwan has not had a locally acquired cases for 30 days. South Korea has had single digit cases until a super-spreader event recently where a Covid-19 positive dude visited 5 nightclubs in one night. Countries such as Brazil, Russia, Mexico, etc. are unfortunately in the exponential increase phase right now (Russia is plateauing at around 10,000 new cases per day). Curiously, although the numbers of new cases and deaths are decreasing in US and UK, they do not seem to have it under control.\nMy guess is that Germany is able to keep the daily new cases low by performing aggressive testing, tracing, and isolation of new cases. They recently found some outbreaks in nursing homes and in meatpacking plants in 3 states (just like the US!), and they immediately decided to test all workers at all meatpacking plants in Germany. It seems to be that if the reproduction number is steady (R \u0026lt;= 1), and the small regional outbreaks are quickly controlled, then there is a chance to keep the whole thing under control. This requires the availability of plenty of tests, trained individuals to conduct the tests, labs who will process the tests in a timely manner, and tracers who will call up all people recently in contact with inidviduals who have tested positive.\nWhy do some countries have new daily cases that won\u0026rsquo;t come down even with shelter-in-place orders? It\u0026rsquo;s probably because 1) not enough tests are administered each day, so people who have the virus are still out and about infecting others; 2) many people have jobs that are not possible to work from home. Even if they are sick, they need to keep working outside to put food on the table; 3) shared residences. If multiple people share a residence, then if once person gets sick with Covid-19, he/she can pass it on to other members within the residence. There can of course be other reasons that I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought of yet.\nThe Swedish case The world\u0026rsquo;s media such as CNN and BBC seem to be fascinated with Sweden\u0026rsquo;s decision to not do a lockdown. Some articles are of the opinion that Sweden has been too wreckless: look how their number of deaths are so much higher than their Scandinavian neighbors (US and UK aren\u0026rsquo;t doing so well themselves). Others express admiration for the Swedish model compared to worse-hit countries such as Switzerland, confusing the more relaxed response to a smaller magnitude of outbreak for the cause of the size of outbreak. A more recent article ponders if America should adopt the Swedish model or the German model, concluding that Americans will probably be unable to emulate either model, due to lower trust/obedience of authority and lower levels of organization.\nMy take is that Sweden has a specific goal, which is to avoid overwhelming their healthcare system. They have achieved this by not treating some of the elderly who have multiple chronic condition and have contracted the virus. I cannot say if this is right or wrong, because it seems that in other countries, many of these patients did not survive even with medical treatments. Sweden admitted that it failed to better protect the elderly in nursing homes, and has since taken measures to improve the protections. Some Americans want to copy the Swedish model, with the reasons to \u0026ldquo;save the economy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo;, but the economy in Sweden has also taken a hit from the virus, and many Swedes chose to work from home and to reduce travel within the city and out of town. I\u0026rsquo;m sure some of them are not happy that their parents or grandparents have died prematurely due to the government\u0026rsquo;s inadequate measures.\nInfectious disease dilemma I understand some people feel that it should be their personal choice whether or not to take a risk with the virus and have the freedom to go to the bar/reopen their business etc. However, maybe the person who takes the risk is healthy enough to handle the sickness, but the the ones they infect are less healthy and suffer some permanent lung damage or die of Covid-19. Or maybe one doesn\u0026rsquo;t know one has some underlying health issues and get more sick than expected. For those who want everything to open back up, perhaps should be creative and come up with various ways to re-organize bars, restaurants, cinemas, airplanes, offices, gyms etc. to reduce viral transmission. Submissions of such suggestions to the authority may be a more productive way to speed up re-opening than armed protests.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what to say about the anti-vaxers. Hopefully their numbers are low enough such that herd immunity could be achieved without having to force vaccinations.\n","href":"/post/coronavirusmay/","title":"Covid-19 development in May"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/covid19/","title":"covid19"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/nyyubio/","title":"nyyubio"},{"content":"","href":"/post/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":" Last modified: 2020-04-14.\nThis is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout).

By showing the numbers in logarithmic plot, we can see that the growth curves are slowly bending downwards, thanks to the social distancing measures.\n  \n Cumulative number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants This graph shows the cumulative increase of cases adjusted for the population size of each state. Per capita, Hamburg’s cases are comparable with Bavaria and Baden-Württemburg.\nMay 8, 2020: added data from all 16 German states for this plot.\nApril 11, 2020: I had not realized at all how high Saarland’s numbers were when normalized for its population.\nMay 19, 2020: I am not sure what’s happening with Bremen. It could be just a data entry error, or maybe it just doesn’t have the virus under control at all.\n  \n Number of confirmed new cases in Germany by States since March 17, 2020 This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed new cases. Each data point is averaged over 7 previous consecutive days . Note: This is not necessarily reflective in the increase of actual number of cases each day, since the number of tests for the virus has been increasing as the pandemic progressed.\nApril 9, 2020: The graph doesn’t show it (5 day average, later changed to 7 day average), but the numbers seem to be going up again. Hard to say what the trend is until after Easter holidays. Are the tests processed slower during the holidays? We will see next week.\nApril 18, 2020: I really don’t like that the number of new cases are creeping back up this week for most of the states.\nApril 22, 2020: Modified rolling 5 day average to 7 days to smooth out the curves more.\n  \n Cumulative number of deaths in log scale Data shown since the 5th death.\n  \n Cumulated number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants Added May 20, 2020\nThis graph shows the cumulative increase of deaths adjusted for the population size of each state.\n  \n Number of confirmed new deaths since March 21,2020 This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed deaths.

However, given that the rates of deaths lag behind the rates of confirmed new cases, I expect/hope these numbers to go down for real next week.\n  \n ","href":"/post/germanycases/","title":"Tracking the coronavirus outbreak in Germany from March to June 2020"},{"content":"First Post Hello World!
