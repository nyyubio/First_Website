Their numbers tend to be a bit behind Johns Hopkins and ECDC though.\nOur World in Data: Clean data visualization and statistics about the coronavirus pandemic in the world, including number of cases, amount of testing performed in each country, number of deaths, mortality rates, etc.\nNew York Times coronavirus maps: Clean visualization of cases all over the world with maps, as well as rate of change (the degree in which cases rising) for each country, as well as county- and state-based data for USA.\nWorldometer coronavirus cases: Real-time data collected \u0026ldquo;directly from government\u0026rsquo;s communication channels or indirectly\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how accurate the datasets are, but their numbers are usually higher than all the official numbers, since official numbers are updated only once or a few fixed times a day.\nThe COVID Tracking Project: US State-by-state dataset of coronavirus cases. Includes data on number of tests performed for each state. It also now tracks COVID-19 data generated by other sources.\nGoogle Community Mobility Reports: Google\u0026rsquo;s aggregated mobility reports for each country and local region. Data based on location histories of Google users.\nModeling sites No models are perfect. Change one parameter, and the trajectory of the curve could become completely different. However, you know how the saying goes: all models are wrong, but some might be useful.\nIHME Covid-19 projections: A US-centric, state-by-state projection of number of deaths, beds, ICU units and ventilators needed, assuming full social distancing measures are in place.\nCOVID Act Now: a US-centric projection of the number of hospitalizations needed, depending on the extent of social distancing measures executed. Projects are made at the state and county levels.\nIf you have a website that you really want me to add to this list, please feel free to send it to me.\nLast updated: 2020-04-03.\n","href":"/links/","title":"Links"},{"content":"I am a bioinformatician who is totally nerdy about data visualization, and studying data trends.

Note that for Italy the deaths started occurring only a few days after the start of new case reports, inidicating that they only started tracking covid-19 cases in the ICUs were filling up with covid-19 patients.\nNote: this chart is still a work in progress.

German data is obtained from the Robert Koch Institute. Data used from March 15-April 7, 2020 (not updated every day).\nFor more extensive information about SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in English, see here.\n \nCumulative number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany in linear scale since 100th case  \n Number of confirmed cases shown in logarithmic scale For exponential growth, the amount of time cases increase from 100 to 1000 is roughly the same as the amount of time it goes from 1000 to 10000. By showing the numbers in logarithmic plot, we can see that the growth curves are slowly bending downwards, thanks to the social distancing measures.\n  \n Cumulative number of cases per 100,000 population This graph shows the cumulative increase of cases adjusted for the population size of each state. Per capita, Hamburgâ€™s cases are comparable with Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemburg.\nMay 8, 2020: added data from all 16 German states for this plot.\nApril 11, 2020: I had not realized at all how high Saarlandâ€™s numbers were when normalized for its population.\n  \n Number of confirmed new cases in Germany by States since March 17, 2020 This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed new cases. Each data point is averaged over 7 previous consecutive days . Note: This is not necessarily reflective in the increase of actual number of cases each day, since the number of tests for the virus has been increasing as the pandemic progressed.\nApril 9, 2020: The graph doesnâ€™t show it (5 day average, later changed to 7 day average), but the numbers seem to be going up again. Hard to say what the trend is until after Easter holidays. Are the tests processed slower during the holidays? We will see next week.\nApril 18, 2020: I really donâ€™t like that the number of new cases are creeping back up this week for most of the states.\nApril 22, 2020: Modified rolling 5 day average to 7 days to smooth out the curves more.\n  \n Cumulative number of deaths in log scale Data shown since the 5th death.\n  \n Number of confirmed new deaths since March 21,2020 This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed deaths. Each data point is averaged over past 7 consecutive days. (modified from 5-day average to 7 days on April 25,2020).\nApril 12, 2020: Note: I am not sure if the decrease in deaths is real or if fewer cases and deaths are reported over the Easter long weekeend.\nApril 16, 2020: Sure enough, the rates of reported deaths went back up on work days. However, given that the rates of deaths lag behind the rates of confirmed new cases, I expect/hope these numbers to go down for real next week.\n  \n ","href":"/post/germanycases/","title":"A Snapshot of the coronavirus outbreak in Germany in April 2020"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/blog/","title":"blog"},{"content":"First Post Hello World! I have always wanted to learn make a webpage, but lacked time, focus, and interesting contents to place on the website. I am currently searching for employement, but due to the coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 outbreak, both the economy and I are undergoing a lockdown right now. What better time than now to teach myself some skills that will make me more employable when pandemic become under control and the economy goes into recovery!\nI plan to work on the following topics during the lockdown:\n Learn to make a website Improve my data visualization skills Play with machine learning algorthms (that is a step before the AI / Deep learning stuff) Follow the SARS-Cov-2 development with the data visualization stuff Market myself as a data scientist ðŸ’ª ðŸ•¶  I am learning through blogdown (because I want to be able to post graphs generated by R) and Hugo. I chose the Minimo theme as I thought it is clean looking and would be simple to use. Was surprised by how much there is to learn!
