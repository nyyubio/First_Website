#### Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related links

[Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center]: Updated data and news on the coronavirus update, with dashboards and many useful data visualizations.

[ECDC]: European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which has pretty good updated data and visualizations for the coronavirus outbreak.

[WHO page for coronavirus pandemic]: The official numbers from WHO. Their numbers tend to be a bit behind Johns Hopkins and ECDC though.

[Our World in Data]: Clean data visualization and statistics about the coronavirus pandemic in the world, including number of cases, amount of testing performed in each country, number of deaths, mortality rates, etc.

[Worldometer coronavirus cases]: Real-time data collected "directly from government's communication channels or indirectly". I don't know how accurate the datasets are, but their numbers are usually higher than all the official numbers, since official numbers are updated only once or a few fixed times a day. 

[The COVID Tracking Project]: US State-by-state dataset of coronavirus cases. Includes data on number of tests performed for each state. 

[ECDC]: https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19-pandemic
[Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center]: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/
[Our World in Data]: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus
[Worldometer coronavirus cases]: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
[WHO page for coronavirus pandemic]: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019
[The COVID Tracking Project]: https://covidtracking.com/

#### Modeling sites

No models are perfect. Change one parameter, and the trajectory of the curve could be completely different. However, you know how the saying goes: *all models are wrong, but some might be useful*.

[IHME Covid-19 projections]: a US-centric, state-by-state projection of number of deaths, beds, ICU units and ventilators needed, assuming full social distancing measures are in place. 

[COVID Act Now]: a US-centric projection of the number of hospitalizations needed, depending on the extent of social distancing measures executed. Projects are made at the state and county levels.

[IHME Covid-19 projections]: https://covid19.healthdata.org/
[COVID Act Now]: https://covidactnow.org/
