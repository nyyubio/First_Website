#### Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related links

[Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center]: Latest data and news on the coronavirus outbreak, with dashboards and many useful data visualizations.

[ECDC]: European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, which has pretty good updated data and visualizations for the coronavirus outbreak.

[WHO page for coronavirus pandemic]: The official numbers from WHO. Their numbers tend to be a bit behind Johns Hopkins and ECDC though.

[Our World in Data]: Clean data visualization and statistics about the coronavirus pandemic in the world, including number of cases, amount of testing performed in each country, number of deaths, mortality rates, etc.

[New York Times coronavirus maps]: Clean visualization of cases all over the world with maps, as well as rate of change (the degree in which cases rising) for each country, as well as county- and state-based data for USA.

[Worldometer coronavirus cases]: Real-time data collected "directly from government's communication channels or indirectly". I don't know how accurate the datasets are, but their numbers are usually higher than all the official numbers, since official numbers are updated only once or a few fixed times a day. 

[The COVID Tracking Project]: US State-by-state dataset of coronavirus cases. Includes data on number of tests performed for each state. It also now tracks COVID-19 data generated by other sources.

[Google Community Mobility Reports]: Google's aggregated mobility reports for each country and local region. Data based on location histories of Google users.

#### Modeling sites

No models are perfect. Change one parameter, and the trajectory of the curve could become completely different. However, you know how the saying goes: *all models are wrong, but some might be useful*.

[IHME Covid-19 projections]: A US-centric, state-by-state projection of number of deaths, beds, ICU units and ventilators needed, assuming full social distancing measures are in place. 

[COVID Act Now]: a US-centric projection of the number of hospitalizations needed, depending on the extent of social distancing measures executed. Projects are made at the state and county levels.
