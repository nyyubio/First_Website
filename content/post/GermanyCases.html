<p><em>Last modified: 2020-04-08.</em></p>
<p>This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from the <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html">Robert Koch Institute</a>. Data used from March 15-April 7, 2020 (not updated every day).</p>
<p>For more extensive information about SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in English, see <a href="https://www.german-way.com/for-expats/living-in-germany/expat-how-to-guides-for-germany/coronavirus-in-germany-information/">here</a>.</p>

<h5>Cumulative number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany in linear scale since 100th case</h5>
<p>Only the top 10 states with the highest number of cases are plotted.</p>

<h5>Number of confirmed cases shown in logarithmic scale</h5>
<p>For exponential growth, the amount of time cases increase from 100 to 1000 is roughly the same as the amount of time it goes from 1000 to 10000. By showing the numbers in logarithmic plot, we can see that the growth curves are slowly bending downwards, thanks to the social distancing measures.</p>

<div id="cumulative-number-of-cases-per-100000-population" class="section level5">
<h5>Cumulative number of cases per 100,000 population</h5>
<p>This graph shows the cumulative increase of cases adjusted for the population size of each state. Per capita, Hamburg’s cases are comparable with Bavaria and Baden-Württemburg.</p>

<div id="number-of-confirmed-new-cases-in-germany-by-states-since-march-1-2020" class="section level5">
<h5>Number of confirmed new cases in Germany by States since March 1, 2020</h5>
<p>This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed new cases each day, each data point is averaged over 5 consecutive days. Note: This is not necessarily reflective in the increase of <em>actual</em> number of cases each day, since the number of tests for the virus has been increasing as the pandemic progressed.</p>
