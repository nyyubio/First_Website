<p>This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from the <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html">Robert Koch Institute</a>. Data used from March 15-April 3, 2020 (not updated every day).</p>
<p>For more extensive information about SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in English, see <a href="https://www.german-way.com/for-expats/living-in-germany/expat-how-to-guides-for-germany/coronavirus-in-germany-information/">here</a>.</p>

<h5>Cumulative number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany in linear scale since 100th case</h5>
<p>Only the top 10 states with the highest number of cases are plotted.</p>

<div id="number-of-confirmed-cases-shown-in-logarithmic-scale" class="section level5">
<h5>Number of confirmed cases shown in logarithmic scale</h5>
<p>For exponential growth, the amount of time cases increase from 100 to 1000 is roughly the same as the amount of time it goes from 1000 to 10000. By showing the numbers in logarithmic plot, we can see that the growth curves are slowly bending downwards, thanks to the social distancing measures.</p>

<div id="cumulative-number-of-cases-per-100000-population" class="section level5">
<h5>Cumulative number of cases per 100,000 population</h5>
<p>This graph shows the cumulative increase of cases adjusted for the population size of each state. Per capita, Hamburg’s cases are comparable with Bavaria and Baden-Württemburg (up until April 2, 2020).</p>

<div id="number-of-new-cases-in-germany-by-states-since-march-17-2020" class="section level5">
<h5>Number of new cases in Germany by States since March 17, 2020</h5>
<p>10 states with the highest number of deaths are shown, each data point is averaged over 5 consecutive days, since testing data is not consistantly reported every day. These curves show a trend of new cases growing over time, but have been flattening sooner for the states with fewer cases, and later for Baden Württemburg and Bavaria.</p>

<p><em><strong>April 3, 2020</strong>: Looks like the growth curve is finally starting to flatten for Bavaria (probably needs a few more days to be certain). I sincerely hope the trend continues (since I live there).</em></p>

<p><em><strong>April 01, 2020</strong>: Looks like the curve for the number of deaths in North Rhine-Westphalia is flattening. I hope the trend continues.</em>
