<p>This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from [Robert Koch Institute]. Data up to April 1, 2020 (not updated every day).</p>

<h5>Cumulative number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Germany in linear scale since 100th case</h5>
<p>Only the top 10 states with the highest number of cases are plotted.</p>

<h5>Number of new cases in Germany by States since March 17, 2020</h5>
<p>10 states with the highest cases are shown, each data point is averaged over 2 consecutive days, since data isnâ€™t consistantly reported every day</p>

<p><strong>April 01, 2020</strong>: Looks like the curve for the number of deaths in North Rhine-Westphalia is flattening. I hope the trend continues.
