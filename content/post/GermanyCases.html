<p><em>Last modified: 2021-08-19.</em></p>
<p>This is my attempt to visualize some SARS-CoV-2 data with some R code (please pardon the non-optimal layout). German data is obtained from the <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html">Robert Koch Institute</a>. Data used from March 15, 2020 (not updated every day).</p>
<p>For more extensive information about SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in English, see <a href="https://www.german-way.com/for-expats/living-in-germany/expat-how-to-guides-for-germany/coronavirus-in-germany-information/">here</a>.</p>

<h5>Number of confirmed cases shown in logarithmic scale</h5>
<p>For exponential growth, the amount of time cases increase from 100 to 1000 is roughly the same as the amount of time it goes from 1000 to 10000. By showing the numbers in logarithmic plot, we can see that the growth curves are slowly bending downwards, thanks to the social distancing measures.</p>

<h5>Cumulative number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants</h5>
<p>This graph shows the cumulative increase of cases adjusted for the population size of each state. Per capita, Hamburg’s cases are comparable with Bavaria and Baden-Württemburg.</p>
<p><em><strong>May 8, 2020</strong>: added data from all 16 German states for this plot.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>April 11, 2020</strong>: I had not realized at all how high Saarland’s numbers were when normalized for its population.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>May 19, 2020</strong>: I am not sure what’s happening with Bremen. It could be just a data entry error, or maybe it just doesn’t have the virus under control at all.</em></p>

<div id="number-of-confirmed-new-cases-in-germany-by-states-since-march-17-2020" class="section level5">
<h5>Number of confirmed new cases in Germany by States since March 17, 2020</h5>
<p>This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed new cases. Each data point is averaged over 7 previous consecutive days . Note: This is not necessarily reflective in the increase of <em>actual</em> number of cases each day, since the number of tests for the virus has been increasing as the pandemic progressed.</p>
<p><em><strong>April 9, 2020</strong>: The graph doesn’t show it (5 day average, later changed to 7 day average), but the numbers seem to be going up again. Hard to say what the trend is until after Easter holidays. Are the tests processed slower during the holidays? We will see next week.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>April 18, 2020</strong>: I really don’t like that the number of new cases are creeping back up this week for most of the states.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>April 22, 2020</strong>: Modified rolling 5 day average to 7 days to smooth out the curves more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>December 29, 2020</strong>: Note that during the Christmas holidays the numbers are artificially low as there are fewer tests conducted; fewer people go get tested, and also the reporting of numbers are delayed.</em></p>

<h5>Number of confirmed new deaths since March 21,2020</h5>
<p>This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed deaths. Each data point is averaged over past 7 consecutive days. <em>(modified from 5-day average to 7 days on April 25,2020).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>April 12, 2020</strong>: Note: I am not sure if the decrease in deaths is real or if fewer cases and deaths are reported over the Easter long weekeend.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>April 16, 2020</strong>: Sure enough, the rates of reported deaths went back up on work days. However, given that the rates of deaths lag behind the rates of confirmed new cases, I expect/hope these numbers to go down for real next week.</em></p>
