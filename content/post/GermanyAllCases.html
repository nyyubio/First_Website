<p><em>Data source: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus">Our World In Data</a></em></p>
<p><em><strong>December 2, 2020</strong></em>: Our World In Data originally obtained their data from ECDC. They have since switched data source to John Hopkins, and the daily numbers looked different from ECDC/RKI, due to different ways of updating their data. Therefore I have switched data source to <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html">RKI</a> which seems to be the primary source for ECDC.</p>

<h5>Number of confirmed new cases in Germany since March 15, 2020</h5>
<p>This plot shows the increase in the number of confirmed new cases. Each data point is averaged over 7 previous consecutive days . Note: This is not necessarily reflective in the increase of <em>actual</em> number of cases each day, since the number of tests for the virus has been increasing as the pandemic progressed.</p>
<p><em><strong>December 28, 2020</strong>: Note that during the Christmas holidays the numbers are artificially low as there are fewer tests conducted, fewer people go get tested, and also the reporting of numbers are delayed.</em></p>
